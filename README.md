# HungerGames

This Android application allows users to upload images and descriptions of leftover food, with the objective of notifying other users within a predetermined radius about the type (eg. pizza or doughnuts) and proximity of the food (eg. showing users where the event is posted from on a map) in an attempt to tackle the problem of food waste and at the same time giving users the opportunity to enjoy free food.
