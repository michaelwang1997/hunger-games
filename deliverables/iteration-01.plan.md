#### Events

 * Meetings with high priority will take place in the Bahen Centre for Information Technology, whereas trivial discussions will occur over Slack. 
   The purpose of the in-person meetings will be to identify and debate which ideas to pursue, as well as deciding on team roles. Any clarifications 
   or personal communications can be made online. To ensure steady progress, our group aims to meet every week to share ongoing progress and plan for the future. 


#### Artifacts

 * The primary artifact we will produce in order to organize our team is Github Projects, which is Github's integrated version of Trello boards. It consists of a list of lists, 
   filled with cards. Each card represents a task or issue and is integrated within a github project and have access to all the issues on the github project. The categories will 
   be broken down into to-do, doing and done, allowing us to keep track of what still needs to be done and the progress that has been made thus far. Each of these tasks will also 
   be assigned a team member(s) and priority, to ensure everyone is responsible for contributing. 


## Product

#### Goals and tasks

 * The goal for this iteration is to brainstorm ideas to present and/or pitch to the TA in the following tutorial. 
   We will also try to identify as many issues as possible that we can address with the TA and receive feedback on for the appropriate course of action. Once an idea is agreed upon, 
   we will assign roles to every member of the team and begin to discuss specifics.


#### Artifacts

 * The primary artifact we will produce in order to present our project idea is an initial mock-up of the user interface built using graphic design software. The UI/UX designer will 
   reach out for inspiration from other members of the team, but will be responsible for its design and creation. A mock-up allows us to display key features of the application, making 
   it easier for others to obtain a visual understanding of its functionality, identify any flaws, and provide suggestions for improvement.
