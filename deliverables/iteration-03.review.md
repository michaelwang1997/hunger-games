# TEAM 22/HungerGames


## Iteration 03 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: November 30th, 2017
 * Where: New College, Wetmore Hall

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well
 
 * Changing the frequency of communications allowed more work to be done remotely. Taking into account that every member could not meet due to varying schedules we moved a majority of work online and it turned out quite well with regular commits being made. By the time we met for our meetings we already had a majority of the coding work done and merged.
 * The decision to start earlier has allowed us a buffer to polish the product. A majority of the coding was completed before the review meeting and only the task of integrating the two ends was left. This left us with more time to focus on the presentation and the video deliverable.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

 * Assigning available team members to merge branches into master caused a few issues. Especially when merging while a branch was both ahead and behind the master at the same time. Frequent updates were made and posted however merges were not being properly handled.
 * Improved time management did not pan out as well as one might hope. Nearing the end of term increased workloads and final assignment difficulties put more time constraints on each member.

#### Planned changes

 * We are moving from agile to waterfall methodology due to the current state of the app. It is no longer feasible to work on different features of the app simultaneously. 
 
 
## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:
 
* The front-end team implemented the following pages/features based on the initial meeting: “User Profile and Preferences” page allows users to choose which foods they wish to be notified of. Users are now directly taken to map after submitting an event. User name added to nav drawer. Event can now be deleted without requiring an alert dialog for ease of use. Some UI icons changed to make the app look better overall.
* The back-end team implemented user preferences to be stored in the database. Images are now connected to each event and stored in the database. When a user views an event, the image is fetched via its id and displayed.
* The two teams collaborated to integrate the front end pages to the backend database implementation ensuring the app compiles and runs as intended.

 
#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:
   
 * Sending notifications based on user set food preferences which requires the user to be able to edit his own profile. Since we haven’t implemented the “Settings” page yet, this bottleneck prevented us from implementing the targeted notification feature. The application should allow users creating events to take a picture of the food rather than choosing one from their gallery.

## Meeting Highlights
 
 * Decided upon how much of the product will make it to the MVP. Time allocation and current stage of product guided the level set. All useful features implemented and decisions such as when to time out an event have been finalized.
 * Script prepared for the video and feedback from previous iteration taken into account in order to make sure each feature is displayed prominently.
