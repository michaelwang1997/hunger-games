# TEAM 22/HungerGames


## Iteration 03 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: November 30th, 2017
 * Where: New College, Wetmore Hall

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well
 
 * Changing the frequency of communications allowed more work to be done remotely. Taking into account that every member could not meet due to varying schedules we moved a majority of work online and it turned out quite well with regular commits being made. By the time we met for our meetings we already had a majority of the coding work done and merged.
 * The decision to start earlier has allowed us a buffer to polish the product. A majority of the coding was completed before the review meeting and only the task of integrating the two ends was left. This left us with more time to focus on the presentation and the video deliverable.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

 * Assigning available team members to merge branches into master caused a few issues. Especially when merging while a branch was both ahead and behind the master at the same time. Frequent updates were made and posted however merges were not being properly handled.
 * Improved time management did not pan out as well as one might hope. Nearing the end of term increased workloads and final assignment difficulties put more time constraints on each member. Setting up the final meeting time was difficult as all seven members were not available.

#### Planned changes

 * We are moving from agile to waterfall methodology due to the current state of the app. It is no longer feasible to work on different features of the app simultaneously. Agile was the right way to go initially as team members were coming up with new features frequently but now that the baseline has been set the requirements for the project are not at a high risk of change.
 
 
## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:
 
 * The front-end team implemented the following pages/features based on the initial meeting: “User Profile and Preferences” page allows users to choose which foods they wish to be notified of. Users are now directly taken to map after submitting an event. User name added to nav drawer. Event can now be deleted without requiring an alert dialog for ease of use. Some UI icons changed to make the app look better overall.
 * The back-end team implemented user preferences to be stored in the database. Images are now connected to each event and stored in the database. When a user views an event, the image is fetched via its id and displayed.
 * The two teams collaborated to integrate the front end pages to the backend database implementation ensuring the app compiles and runs as intended.
 * Unplanned goals implemented: As more features were integrated between the two teams, changes were made as to how the user class was being instantiated and stored leading to ease of use among other classes. The initial implementation was only working when separated from the front-end.

 
#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:
   
 * At the moment all users are notified based on their preferences regardless of their distance from events. Proximity based notifications is one of the last main features of the MVP. This is due to integrating the two ends and the preference based notifications taking much longer to implement than anticipated.

## Meeting Highlights
 
 * Decided upon how much of the product will make it to the MVP. Time allocation and current stage of product guided the level set. Almost all useful features implemented and decisions such as when to time out an event have been finalized.
 * Script prepared for the video and feedback from previous iteration taken into account in order to make sure each feature is displayed prominently.
