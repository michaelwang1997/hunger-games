# TEAM 22/HungerGames

 
## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: October 12th, 2017
 * Where:  DGP Labs, Bahen

#### Decisions that turned out well

 * A large group meeting where everyone was able to share, discuss and refine their ideas was crucial as it allowed all team members to be on the same page regarding 
   the product, its function, features and design prior to the development phase. Next, having decided on roles and responsibilities at an early stage allowed each member 
   of the team to focus on their individuals goals and contributions to the product.


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

 * The large group meetings, where important issues were to be discussed, were often delayed or extended due to digressions taking place throughout. This was not ideal from 
   a time management perspective, as although we were able to complete what was required, it often took longer than necessary. Next, our spontaneous discussions over Slack were 
   not planned ahead of time, thus certain members of the team were not active during them. Thus, they were unable to contribute to the discussions as they were happening.


#### Planned changes

 * In the future, our large group meetings will be more organized, with distractions kept to a minimum. This way, we can increase efficiency and productivity. In the future, we will 
   also have a more structured approach to our Slack conversations, particularly nearing sprint and deliverable deadlines to ensure all members of the team are on the same page. Our 
   large group meetings will also be more organized going forward, with distractions kept to a minimum. 


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * A goal that we aimed to achieve prior to developing our application was to identify how to minimize the number of potential issues that could arise down the line. One of these issues 
   was how we would prevent users from making multiple fake or spam accounts. To discourage this, we will implement a rating system, and look into the possibility of shadow banning. Next, 
   we were looking for a solution to the issue of the poster having to stick around until the food has been distributed. However, we came to the realization that the poster can decide to grant 
   the users the ability to end the event, or do it themselves depending on the circumstances. We also narrowed down our target user to ensure we were actually solving a real world problem in favour 
   of offering yet another marketing tool. Lastly, we designed an initial mock-up of the dashboard for our application, and will be refining it throughout the development phase.


#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * Our group planned on having a design that would be representative of the final product, however we are in still in the process of deciding the appropriate colour scheme, theme and exact layout. We 
   decided to allocate more of our time and resources to tackling other issues that we felt were of greater priority before coming back to this.


## Meeting Highlights

 * Going into the next iteration, our main insights are to have decided on a design for the dashboard and/or landing page of the application. This will give us a more concrete visualization of the product 
   and keep us on the right track. We also hope to have a skeleton of the front-end that builds on the rough sketch of our mock-up, and possibly have it running on an Android device.
