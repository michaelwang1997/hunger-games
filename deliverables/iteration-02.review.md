# TEAM 22/HungerGames


## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: November 16th, 2017
 * Where: New College, Wetmore Hall

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well
 
 * The decision to create a video mock-up prior to development turned out to be successful as the front-end team frequently referred back to it whilst designing the layout of the pages. Furthermore, the presentation proved to be valuable for reinforcing our primary objective throughout the development phase. Next, the decision to hold group meetings with all members of the team on a weekly basis allowed us to make sure everyone was always on the same page, aware of the current progress and the next steps. Finally, dividing the work into front-end and back-end tasks resulted in increased efficiency, as both teams were able to focus on meeting distinct criteria, prior to combining our efforts at recurring intervals.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

 * The decision to use multiple branches had its advantages, but was not as effective as we had initially hoped. This was due to the fact that on occasion, a particular branch would exceed another by a significant number of commits. As a result, when a merge was attempted, we were required to resolve numerous conflicts. The next decision which proved to be rather ineffective was developing the application until the day of the deadline. Ideally, we would have liked to suspend development a day or two in advance in order to ensure we have ample time to polish our application for the second deliverable. However, the busy workloads of our team members prevented us from doing so. 

#### Planned changes

 * In the future, we will aim to improve our time management by pushing ourselves to meet a predetermined deadline which will allow us to set aside enough time for refinements as the actual due date approaches. Moreover, we will improve communication between the front-end and back-end teams by providing more frequent updates to minimize the possibility of Git conflicts. 
 

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:
 
 * The vast majority of the goals we had set out for this iteration were met by the deadline. These consisted of having the front-end team design an intuitive user interface, and the back-end team effectively connect our application to a database as a means of storing and organizing data such as users and events. We were able to design all of the pages we had planned for, and implement the underlying functionality to bring them to life. A task which we accomplished, albeit was not part of our original plan, was to integrate Google Sign-In functionality, which provides additional convenience for the user.
 
#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:
   
 * A goal which we have yet to meet is to ensure notifications are only sent out to users who declare interest and are within a certain proximity of the event. We decided to prioritize other tasks ahead of this, since this feature relies on the other components of our application. Due to time constraints, we were not able to get to this, however we are now in a position to begin implementing this feature.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:
 
 * Going into the next iteration, one of our main goals is to incorporate targeted notifications, which will only be sent out to users who meet the criteria. We will also need to design and develop additional intermediary pages for certain actions that a user may take. The map should populate in real time when a user creates an event, and the event should be visible in the my events and/or all events page. A user should be able to declare their interest in an event, and be notified about its status. Last but not least, we intend to have our minimum viable product that tackles a real world problem completed and ready to be published.
