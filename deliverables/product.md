#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

 *The mobile application being developed by our group allows users to upload images and descriptions of leftover food, with the objective of notifying other users 
 within a predetermined radius about the type (eg. pizza or doughnuts) and proximity of the food (eg. showing users where the event is posted from on a map). 
 To ensure the notifications are targeted, users will be required to enter information about their personal preferences (eg. choosing to only get notified in a 
 certain radius, or choosing to only get notified about pizza) as part of their profile. They will also be able to follow any posts of their liking to receive 
 active updates about it. Furthermore, the description of the posts will include key information about the food, such as which category it belongs to and any dietary 
 restrictions it caters to, so that users are able to make an informed decision. This application will contribute towards the efforts of minimizing food waste, as club 
 and event organizers on campuses will be able to reach out to students who are seeking free food that they would otherwise not have access to. From our research, we found 
 that the lack of communication between the person wasting food and the people seeking food is the single largest issue when it comes to food waste. The user interface for 
 the application will be intuitive and seamless to navigate for both the poster as well as the other users. The poster will be able to select an estimate of how many people 
 it will feed (eg. 5-10 or 10-15) from various ranges using a drop-down menu. They will have the ability to permit the followers of the post to end the event, or chose to do it 
 themselves. When the event has ended, other users who expressed interest in the food will promptly receive a notification that it is no longer available. Finally, a rating system 
 will be in place to ensure the posters are trustworthy.

#### Q2: Who are your target users?

 *The primary users for this application are event organizers on campuses that have leftover food from events, in addition to students in close proximity to these events that are 
  in search of a meal. We chose this target user because a technology that is tailored towards notifying post-secondary school students does not currently exist. An example of the 
  target users could be the following:
  *1. A club president or event organizer on campus who expects a certain number of people to attend their event hoping that the food they bought would be sufficient. However, they 
      are left with a surplus of food after the event as their estimation was inaccurate, not knowing what to do with the food in the middle of the night or during a busy school day. 
  *2. The students who are near the location of the event but are unaware that such an event was hosted, yet would love to have some free food. 



#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

 *Users will choose our product as it provides a free and convenient alternative to purchasing expensive meals. Moreover, event organizers using our application will be able to make their 
  events more eco-friendly, as food waste will be largely prevented. Currently, the most common way of notifying students about leftover food is through social media. However, this information 
  is not easily accessible to many students due to various factors, such as inadequate notifications or lack of emphasis. The preferences of our users will ensure only targeted and relevant 
  information is shared, as opposed to the vague and misleading information included in social media posts. Similar ideas to our application have successfully been implemented in Quebec and certain 
  locations in the United Kingdom, where grocery stores and restaurants are notifying their customers about leftover produce:
   * http://www.ubifood.ca/
   * http://flashfood.com/
   
 *However, our application would provide users with a platform that is not restrictive like the aforementioned services. This is because it can be used by any Android user to share information about 
  their event, and the associated food that is leftover. Furthermore, the students are not required to subscribe to any particular organization or individual to receive news from them since they can 
  simply browse events in their nearby proximity and chose to attend any one of their liking.

### Highlights

YOUR ANSWER GOES HERE ...

 *Initially, our group was considering an alternative to help restaurants prevent food waste, as it is commonplace for many restaurants to throw out any remaining food at the end of the day to ensure 
  their food is always fresh. However, given the scope of our project, we concluded that it would not be feasible due to the large number of issues and complications that arise when dealing with established 
  restaurants. These include: 
  * Taking into consideration that the restaurants would not want to be held accountable for any food complaints from users since they have a reputation to maintain. 
  * Restaurants generally have a wider audience and appeal than school clubs, so the ratio of available food to potential users would be disproportionate.
  * We were considering targeting bakeries such as Tim Hortons since they specialize in producing a specific food category that is relatively less perishable than the typical restaurant food. However, upon 
    consulting with a Tim Hortons employee about whether organizations of its nature would ever consider using an application to giveaway leftover food, we realized that they would be more inclined to offer 
	flash advertisements with discounted prices for the food since ultimately they are a business. Unfortunately, this was leading our product to become more of a marketing tool than an application that tackles 
	a real world problem.

 *We opted to develop a mobile application to tackle the issue of food waste as it is far more convenient than the web-based alternatives. Therefore, we modified our target users and adapted our idea to focus 
  on student bodies and club or event organizers at institutions.
