# KANBAN workflow

### Definition of the stages for the project

- ##### Pending 
   -  High-level goals of the project may be placed here so everyone on the team knows about and can be regularly reminded of them.

- ##### Analysis 
   -  Tasks that are under discussion — an uncertain design or code approach that needs to be finalized, for example — may be placed here. When the discussion is finished, it is moved to the next column.

- ##### Design 
   -  Mockups, UI design, prototypes that needs to be worked on, as well as any architecture work that needs to be completed based on the analysis stage's outcomes can be placed in this column.

- ##### Development 
   -  The task lives here until the development of the feature is completed. When the task is complete, it is moved to the next column. If the architecture is incorrect or uncertain, it may be moved back to the previous column.
 
- ##### Test 
   -  The task is in this Kanban column while it is being tested. If there are any issues, it is returned to “Development.” If there are none, then it is moved to the next column.

- ##### Deploy 
   -  Committing code to the repository. Tasks in the column are also the
 tasks that are "Done".
